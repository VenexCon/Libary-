<h2>Libary Project</h2>
<hr> 

<p> This project was intended to showcase the use of constructors, 
    DOM manipulation and limited array functions. I emphasised good commits
     and ensuring good commentary of the code throughout</p>

<p>This code went through multiple refactors in relation to the main script.JS, and although it works much better than the first iteration, there are improvements to be made. </p>
<p>No local storage was used, in the project</p>
